        <h2>The Current State of DeFi</h2>
        <p>Decentralized Finance has matured significantly over the past year. Total Value Locked (TVL) 
        has reached new heights, and we're seeing innovative protocols emerge that address previous limitations.</p>
        
        <h2>Emerging Trends</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cross-chain interoperability is becoming seamless</li>
            <li>Real-world asset tokenization is accelerating</li>
            <li>Sustainable yield strategies are replacing unsustainable APYs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Risk Management</h2>
        <p>Smart contract risks remain a concern. Always verify audit reports and start with smaller 
        positions when exploring new protocols. Diversification across chains and protocols is essential.</p>
