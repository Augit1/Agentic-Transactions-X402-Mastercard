        <h2>NFTs Have Evolved</h2>
        <p>The NFT market has undergone significant transformation. While speculative trading has cooled, 
        practical applications in gaming, identity, and intellectual property are flourishing.</p>
        
        <h2>Where Value is Being Created</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gaming assets with true ownership and interoperability</li>
            <li>Digital identity and credential verification</li>
            <li>Music and entertainment royalty distribution</li>
            <li>Supply chain authentication</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Investment Thesis</h2>
        <p>Look for projects building infrastructure rather than chasing collectible trends. 
        The protocols enabling NFT utility will capture more value than individual collections.</p>
